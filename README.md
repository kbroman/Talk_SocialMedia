### Talk on &ldquo;Social media for data scientists&rdquo;


These are slides for a talk that I gave to the UW-Madison biomedial data
science students on 30 Oct 2019.

I was strongly influenced by [Emi Tanaka](https://emitanaka.org)'s
[talk on this subject](https://emitanaka.org/talk/2019-08-18-isiwsc2019/)
([see her slides](https://emitanaka.org/slides/ISIWSC2019),
which work in Chrome but not Firefox). Also see
[Sherri Rose](http://drsherrirose.org/)'s
[slides on a similar topic](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p5gmrj5vsqrcl7u/UW19_Rose_OnlineScholars.pdf).
